\section*{Exercise 11.1 - Strong stubborn sets}
Consider the $SAS^+$ planning task $\Pi$ with variables 
$V =\{pos,left,right,hat \}, \pazocal{D}_{pos}=\{
home,uni\}$ and $\pazocal{D}_{left}=\pazocal{D}_{right}=\pazocal{D}_{hat}
=\{t,f\}$. The initial state $I = \{pos \mapsto home, left \mapsto f,
right \mapsto f, hat \mapsto f\}$ and the goal specification is
$\gamma = \{pos \mapsto uni\}$. There are four operators in O, namely

\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
	\mbox{wear-left-shoe (WLS)}  & = & \langle pos=home \land left = f, left:=t \rangle\\
	\mbox{wear-right-shoe (WRS)} & = & \langle pos=home \land right = f, right:=t \rangle\\
	\mbox{wear-hat (WH)} 	   & = & \langle pos=home \land hat = f, hat:=t \rangle\\
	\mbox{go-to-university (GU)}& = & \langle pos=home \land left = t \land right = t, pos:=uni \rangle\\
\end{array}\] 

(a) Draw the breadth-first search graph (with duplicate detection) for planning
task $\Pi$ without any form of partial-order reduction.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\begin{scope}
            [
                every node/.style={
					text width = 7.5em },
				active/.style = {draw=green,text= black, very thick}
            ]
            
			\node(a)[text width = 21em] at (0,0) {$\{pos \mapsto home,$ $left\mapsto f,$ $right \mapsto f ,$ $hat \mapsto f \}$};

            \node(c) at (0,-2.5) {$\{pos \mapsto home,$ $left\mapsto f,$ $right \mapsto f ,$ $hat \mapsto t \}$};

			\node(l) at (-4,-10) {$\{pos \mapsto home,$ $left\mapsto t,$ $right \mapsto t ,$ $hat \mapsto t \}$};
			\node(m)[active] at (0,-10) {$\{pos \mapsto uni,$ $left\mapsto t,$ $right \mapsto t ,$ $hat \mapsto f \}$};

            ]
            \path 
            (a) edge         node{$WLS$}(b)
            (a) edge         node{$WH$}(c)

			(f) edge         node{$GU$}(m);
		\end{scope}

\end{center}

(b) Draw the breadth-first search graph (with duplicate detection) for planning task $\Pi$ using
strong stubborn set pruning. For each expansion of a node for a state $s$, specify in detail how
$T_s$ (and thus $T_{app(s)}$) are computed, i.e., explain how the initial disjunctive action landmark
is chosen and how operators are iteratively added to $T_s$ as part of necessary enabling sets or
interfering operators, respectively. Break ties in favor of \emph{wear-left-shoe} over \emph{wear-right-shoe.}\\

\textbf{How many node expansion do you save with strong stubborn sets compared to plain breadth-first search?
 What about the lengths of the resulting solutions?}\\

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\begin{scope}
            [
                every node/.style={minimum width = 7.5em },
				active/.style = {draw=green,text= black, very thick}
            ]
            
			\node(a) at (0,0) {$S_1 = \{pos \mapsto home,$ $left\mapsto f,$ $right \mapsto f ,$ $hat \mapsto f \}$};
			
			\node(b) at (0,-2) {$S_2 = \{pos \mapsto home,$  $left\mapsto t,$  $right \mapsto f ,$ $hat \mapsto f \}$};
			\node(f) at (0,-4) {$S_3 = \{pos \mapsto home,$ $left\mapsto t,$ $right \mapsto t ,$ $hat \mapsto f \}$};
			\node(m)[active] at (0,-6) {$\{pos \mapsto uni,$ $left\mapsto t,$ $right \mapsto t ,$ $hat \mapsto f \}$};

		\end{scope}
		\begin{scope}
            [>={Stealth[black]},
                every node/.style={fill=white},
                every edge/.style={draw=black,text=black},
            ]
            \path 
            (a) edge         node{$WLS$}(b)
			(b) edge         node{$WRS$}(f)
			(f) edge         node{$GU$}(m);
		\end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The strong stubborn set in $S_1$ is determined by taking into account the disjunctive action landmark, we know the operator $go$-$to$-$university$ must be inside this set.\\
As $go$-$to$-$university$ is not applicable in the initial state, then we need to add a neccessary enabling set for this operator, a possible NES is $\{wear$-$left$-$shoe\}$ or $\{wear$-$right$-$shoe\},$ we broke ties by adding the operator $wear$-$left$-$shoe$ to the strong stubborn set.\\
As $wear$-$left$-$shoe$ is applicable, we must add all operators that interfere, the only operator that interferes with this operator is $go$-$to$-$university$ but it is already in the set, therefore:
\begin{center}
	$T_{S_1} = \{go$-$to$-$university, wear$-$left$-$shoe\}$\\
	$T_{S_1} \cap T_{app(S_1)} = \{wear$-$left$-$shoe\}$
\end{center}

The strong stubborn set in $S_2$ is determined using again $\{go$-$to$-$university\}$ as DAL.\\
As $go$-$to$-$university$ is not applicable in $S_2$, then the smallest NES is $\{wear$-$right$-$shoe\}$\\
As $wear$-$right$-$shoe$ is applicable, we must add the operator $go$-$to$-$university$ as it interferes,  but it is already in the set, therefore:
\begin{center}
	$T_{S_2} = \{go$-$to$-$university, wear$-$right$-$shoe\}$\\
	$T_{S_2} \cap T_{app(S_2)} = \{wear$-$right$-$shoe\}$
\end{center}

The strong stubborn set in $S_3$ is determined using again $\{go$-$to$-$university\}$ as DAL.\\
As $go$-$to$-$university$ is applicable in $S_3$, then we need to add all operators that interfere, in this case $go$-$to$-$university$ disables $\{wear$-$left$-$shoe, wear$-$right$-$shoe, wear$-$hat\}$
\begin{center}
	$T_{S_3} = \{go$-$to$-$university, wear$-$left$-$shoe, wear$-$right$-$shoe, wear$-$hat\}$\\
	$T_{S_3} \cap T_{app(S_3)} = \{go$-$to$-$university, wear$-$hat\}$
\end{center}
In this case the first visited node was a goal state, after that we stopped the search.\\\\
By prunning with the strong stubborn set we only visited $4$ states, in contrast without prunning we visited $13$ states, $9$ states more, which represents approximately a $30\%$ of the previous graph.
